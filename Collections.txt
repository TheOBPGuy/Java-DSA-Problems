Differences between ArrayList and Vector:

1.  ArrayList is not symchronized - avoid accessing them from multiple threads
2. ArrayList is not a legacy class - not used in previos java versions aka 
not previously on the Collections framework. 
3. ArrayList increases its size by 50% of the array size.
4. ArrayList is not thread safe as its not symchronized.

1. Vector is symchronized
2. Vector is a legacy class
3. Vector increases its size by doubling the array size
4. Vector list is thread safe asits every method is synchronized

Differneces between ArrayList and LinkedList:

1. ArrayList uses dynamic array
2. ArrayList is not effiecient for manipulation because too much is required.
3. ArrayList is better to store and fetch data
4. ArrayList provides random access
5. ArrayList takes less memory overhead as it stores only object

1. LinkedList uses a doubly linked list.
2. LinkedList is efficient for manipulation
3. LinkedList is better to manipulate data
4. LinkedList takes more memory overhead as it stores the object as well as the
 address of that object
