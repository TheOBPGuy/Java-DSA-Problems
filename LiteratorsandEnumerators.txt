Differences between Iterator and ListIterator:

1. Iterator traverses the elements in forward direction
2. Iterator can be used in List, Set and Queue
3. Iterator can only perform remove operation while traversing the collection.

1. ListIterator traverses the elements in backward and forward directions
2. ListIterator can be used in List only.
3. ListIterator can perform add, remove, set operation while traversing the 
    collection.

Differences between Iterator and Enumeration:

1. Iterator can traverse legacy and non legacy elements
2. Iterators are fail fast - a ConcurrentModificationException will be thrown
    in modifying the object during the iteration process
3. Iterators are slower than Enumeration
4. Iterators can perform remove operation while traversing the collection

1. Enumeration can traverse only legacy elements
2. Enumeration is not fail-fast
3. Enumeration is faster than Iterator
4. Enumeration can perform only travser operation on the collection
